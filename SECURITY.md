## 3rd Party Security Audits

The Firedancer project engages 3rd party firms to conduct independent security audits of Firedancer.

As these 3rd party audits are completed and issues are sufficiently addressed, we make those audit reports public.

## Bug Bounty Program

We are in the process of designing a **bug bounty program** for Firedancer.

In the mean-time, if you find a security issue in Firedancer, we ask that you reach out to our team via Discord.
