fd_hash and fd_hash_memcpy are currently a modified implementation of
the hashing algorithm in xxHash(r39).  xxHash(r39) can be found at
https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/tag/r39 (note the xxHash
source code repository has changed location a few times over the years).

fd_uint_hash and fd_ulong_hash are currently based on the final full
avalanche integer mixing functions, fmix32 and fmix64, found in the
MurmurHash3 hashing algorithm.  Murmur3 can be found at
https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher.
